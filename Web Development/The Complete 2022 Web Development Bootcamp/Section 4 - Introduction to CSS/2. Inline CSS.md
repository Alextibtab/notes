# Notes
Inline CSS is where every time you want to style a HTML element you use the "style" attribute on the HTML tag to write your CSS code while this might work for smaller pages it isn't practical for bigger websites and if you want to style all the \<h1> tags on a page you'd end up having to copy and paste the same code throughout the file. 

example of styling a \<h1> element
```html
<h1 style="font-size: 48px;letter-spacing: 8px;color: white;">Hello World!</h1>
```
```ad-success
<h1 style="font-size: 48px;letter-spacing: 8px;color: white;">Hello World!</h1>
```
Everything inside the quotation marks of the style attribute is CSS code. First I made the font-size 48px in size then changed the spacing between the letters to be 8px and finally set the font color to be white. It is important to make sure you have a : between the style name and the value you assign it and then also close each part with a semicolon.
