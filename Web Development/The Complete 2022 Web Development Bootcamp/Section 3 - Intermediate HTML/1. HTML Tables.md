# Notes
To create HTML tables there is the \<table> tag which is used to wrap the entire table then inside the tags there is the \<tr> tag which is "table row" to create a new table row then to enter data into the table there is the \<td> tag which stands for "table data"

```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Hello</td>
		<td>World</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>This</td>
		<td>is</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>a</td>
		<td>Table!</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
```ad-success
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Hello</td>
		<td>World</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>This</td>
		<td>is</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>a</td>
		<td>Table!</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
The above cells show a simple approach to creating HTML tables but there are a few more tags that can help style the table. The \<thead> tag defines the table header. The \<tbody> tag is for regular table content and finally there is the \<tfoot> tag for footer content

also within the \<thead> tag instead of using \<td> there is the \<th> tag which should be used for table headers.

Simple table with header
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First name</th>
    <th>Last name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

```ad-success
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First name</th>
    <th>Last name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```


Table with thead, tbody and tfoot
```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header content 1</th>
      <th>Header content 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Footer content 1</td>
      <td>Footer content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
```

```ad-success
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header content 1</th>
      <th>Header content 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Footer content 1</td>
      <td>Footer content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
```

The second half of the lecture discusses about the attributes that can be used with the table tags and how most of them are deprecated when looking through the MDN documentation this is because a lot of the table attributes are to do with styling the table which in modern HTML is avoided instead using CSS for styling elements and strictly using HTML for structuring the content and semantic labelling of how certain content should be represented. 
# Keywords/Questions
Learnt about the tags needed when creating tables
How some attributes are deprecated meaning they will still work but there is probably a better more intended way to do something similar.
# Summary
This lecture went over how to make HTML tables.
