First section covers how HTML files should be formatted and making sure to properly indent the HTML tags

Then disccusses why to use the emphasis tag over the italics tag. 
### \<i> vs. \<em>
While the visual result is by default the same for both tags the semantic meaning is different. The \<em> tag represents emphasis of its contents while the \<i> tag represents text that is set off from the normal prose

There is also the \<strong> tag which should be used over the \<b> tag when making words bold because the \<strong> and \<em> tags are about giving the text more meaning rather than just visual appearance to indicate whether the content should have strong importance or be emphasized.
