# Linux Structure

## History
At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to create a new, free operating system kernel. Over the years Linux kernel has gone form a small number of files written in C under licensing that prohibited commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million lines of source code licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.

Linux is available in over 600 distributions based on the Linux kernel. Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems. Since Linux is free and open-source, the source code can be modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone. Linux-based operating systems run on servers, mainframes, desktops, embedded systems such as routers, televisions, video game consoles and more.

| Principle                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Everything is a file`                                        | All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.                                    |
| `Small, single-purpose programs`                              | Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together                                                                |
| `Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks` | The integration and combination of different tools enables us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results. |
| `Avoid captive user interfaces`                               | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell which gives the user greater control over the operating system                                                  |
| `Configuration data stored in a text file`                    | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                                                                                  |

| `Graphics Server` | This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on an X-windowing system.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Window Manager`  | Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options including GNOME, KDE, MATE, Unity and Cinnamon. A desktop environment usually has several applications, including file and web browsers. These allow the user to access and manage the essential and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system. |
| `Utilities`       | Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
