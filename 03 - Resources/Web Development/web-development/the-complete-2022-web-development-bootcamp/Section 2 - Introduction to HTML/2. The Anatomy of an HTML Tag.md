```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```
as seen in the HTML above there is a starting h1 tag then following that the content we want to be displayed as a header and then the closing tag so the browser knows when to revert back to normal text styling.

There are a few exceptions to this such as \<br> which is a self-closing tag because it doesn't take any content there isn't a need to close the tag.

Another tag like \<br> is the \<hr> tag it is also self closing and stands for "Horizontal Rule" and is used to draw seperating lines on the website to seperate content

```html
<hr>
I'm surrounded by lines
<hr>
```

```ad-success
<hr>
I'm surrounded by lines
<hr>
```

Again depending on the obsidian theme these lines might be very simple or have complex CSS styling already applied to them

HTML tags can also have attributes which we can use to tell the browser specific modifications we want to apply to that HTML tag for example the \<hr> rule has an attribute called "size" which will affect how thick the line is
```html
<hr size="5">
Thick line Above
Normal line Below
<hr>
```

```ad-success
<hr size="5">
Thick line Above
Normal line Below
<hr>
```

Again due to obsidian some of these attributes might look like they have no effect. To see which attributes a HTML tag has available to it use the devdocs documentation to get a complete list of all available attributes eg. https://devdocs.io/html/element/hr
