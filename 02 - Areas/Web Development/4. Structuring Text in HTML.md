# Notes
First section covers how HTML files should be formatted and making sure to properly indent the HTML tags

Then disccusses why to use the emphasis tag over the italics tag. 
### \<i> vs. \<em>
While the visual result is by default the same for both tags the semantic meaning is different. The \<em> tag represents emphasis of its contents while the \<i> tag represents text that is set off from the normal prose

There is also the \<strong> tag which should be used over the \<b> tag when making words bold because the \<strong> and \<em> tags are about giving the text more meaning rather than just visual appearance to indicate whether the content should have strong importance or be emphasized.
