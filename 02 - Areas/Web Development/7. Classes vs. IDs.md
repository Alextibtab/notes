# Topic / Title: Classes vs. IDs

# Notes
HTML elements can have classes or IDs assigned to them these can then be references with CSS to apply styles to elements that only have these classes or IDs. Classes and IDs have a higher specificity than just styling the element so any class styling will override CSS styling applied to the element.

Using CSS classes:
```css
.class {
	# CSS Styling
}
```
For styling classes you put a . before the classname to style them.

Using CSS IDs:
```css
#id {
	# CSS Styling
}
```

Classes can be applied to multiple elements while IDs can be applied to a single element and not shared. Classes are used to apply styles to a group of elements.

Elements can have multiple classes but only one ID. Classes are commonly used while using IDs is quite rare.

# Keywords/Questions
Classes can be used to group elements and style them all.
