# Notes
HTML forms let people enter  information into input boxes and then submit these details forms are used heavily throughout websites for posting comments leaving feedback or logging into your account.

Example HTML Form 
```html
<form class="" method="get">
	<label>Your Name:</label>
	<input type="text" name="" value="">
	<input type="submit" name="">
</form>
```
```ad-success
<form class="" method="get">
	<label>Your Name:</label>
	<input type="text" name="" value="">
	<input type="submit" name="">
</form>
```
This example will reload your obsidian page briefly I don't think it causes any issues. 

Normally after submitting a form the state of the website will need to be changed or updated to reflect this for example when logging into an account you might get sent to your profile page when hitting the login button.
