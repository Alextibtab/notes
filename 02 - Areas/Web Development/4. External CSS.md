# Notes
External CSS is similar to Internal CSS where we seperate the CSS and HTML content but instead of storing the CSS inbetween the \<style> tags at the top of the file instead it is stored in it's own .css file then when we want to apply the styles defined in that file we need to use the \<link> tab to import that CSS into the HTML file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
```

# Keywords/Questions
External CSS lets you better organize the structure and style of your website by splitting it up into different files.
