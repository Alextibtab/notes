# Topic / Title: Introduction to HTML

# Notes
HTML = HyperText Markup Language and are based off the markup that would be put into manuscripts where editors would mock up the manuscript and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers. So you might write a squiggle under a line indicating to the publisher that you want this word printed out in bold. HTML works the same you can use tags to specify the layour and structure of the website.

To create a header tag you use the following syntax
````ad-note
title: HTML Tags
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
```
This tag will make the word "Heading" display as a title.
```ad-success
<h1>Heading</h1>
```

For heading tags specifically there is the following options you can choose which just affect the size of the title h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest
```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>  
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>  
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>  
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
```


Depending on what obsidian theme you use the headings might like different as the theme will apply it's own style to the header tags

```ad-success
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>  
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>  
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>  
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
```

Line break tag
```html
some text <br> other text
```
```ad-success
some text <br> other text
```
without the \<br> tag the text would all be displayed on the same line
```ad-info
some text other text
```
