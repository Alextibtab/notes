# Notes
When writing CSS it consists of three main parts
```css
selector { property: value; }
```
The selector is what HTML tag we want to style or as you'll learn later this can be a class or id that is assigned to a HTML tag. The property is what we want to style from the font-size to color or border. Then the value is either a pixel size for font size or a color for setting colors which can either be in hex or rgb.
