# Obsidian Notes

This repository is a collection of my notes for learning various different skills and technologies from a wide range of technical skills and other hobbies like language study.

The note organisation follows the **P**rojects **A**reas **R**esources **A**rchives (PARA) method which breaks down notes into four main categories projects are current pieces of work with a finite goal. Areas are a set skill or activity that is being maintained over time. Resources are for themes or interests. Finally, archives are where finished projects, areas or resources
