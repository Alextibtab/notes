# Obsidian Notes

This repository is a collection of my notes for learning various different skills and technologies from a wide range of technical skills and other hobbies like language study.

The note organisation follows the **P**rojects **A**reas **R**esources **A**rchives (PARA) method which breaks down notes into four main categories projects are current pieces of work with a finite goal. Areas are a set skill or activity that is being maintained over time. Resources are for themes or interests. Finally, archives are where finished projects, areas or resources go. There are some additional folders for daily notes, fleeting notes which are just any ideas or thoughts I want to capture, permanent notes are notes that have been refined from fleeting to something more fleshed out. Then the meta folder contains any templates used throughout the vault.


The Maps of Content(MOCs) folder contains various ways of grouping notes into related categories to help navigate through the vault
