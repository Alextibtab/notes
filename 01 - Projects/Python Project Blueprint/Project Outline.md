# Python Automation project

This project aims to create an optimal starting blueprint for any python projects utilising automation libraries for handling tasks such as; formatting, testing and building. 

This project will focus on utilising the following libraries; [[Tox Testing Automation|tox]], [[Ruff Linter & Formatter|ruff]], and [[Invoke Task Automation|invoke]] while also using the newer [[Pyproject.toml Configuration|pyproject.toml]] instead of setup.py.
