# Using SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that runs on port `22` by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using public-key authentication using an SSH public/private key pair. SSH can be used to remotely access systems on the same network , over the internet, facilitate connections to resources in other networks using port forwarding/proxying, and upload/download files to and from the remote systems.

SSH uses a client-server model, connecting a user running an SSH client application such as `OpenSSH` to an SSH server. While attacking a box or during a real world assessment , SSH is often used once obtaining credentials or an SSH private key to obtain an SSH connection to the machine.

Example Usage:
